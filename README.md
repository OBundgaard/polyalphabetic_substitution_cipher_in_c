# Polyalphabetic Substitution Cipher algorithm in C
First real project in C - Encrypts/decrypts a message using a password and keyword, CIA style.

The project was originally made in python, and I had in mind to make a flask application, but eventually decided to challenge myself in C instead - converting from Python to C.
As mentioned this is my first project in C; I have obviously tried "Hello world!" in C, but this is the first real project I've done in the language. 

It may not be the most effective project, but it got the job done when I ran it for a trial run. You are free to use it and optimize it as you wish, and feel even more free to implement it in a GUI application if you have nothing better to do! :D
